# Astronomical-Clock [in progress]
The Prauge astronomical clock displays the local time, the positiion of the sun and moon relative to the zodiacal constellations, and the position of the sun and moon relative to the horizon. The goal of this project is to recreate the center dial of the clock on a wall-mounted LCD display. 

## Hardware:
NV3052C Round 4" display.

Qualia ESP32-S3 micropcontroller driver board.

Bezel is to be 3D Printed.


## Software:
The ESP32-S3 supports CircuitPy.

A web project exists under free licenses that displays the clock on a web interface. This will need to be adapted to run on the microcontroller.
